I'm currently finishing up a Master's in Biostatistics at Columbia. I conduct research in [Dr. David Lederer's clinical epidemiology lab](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/pulmonary/research/PICTOR). I'm passionate about using data and statistics to advance public health research and improve lives. 

I love cooking, baking, trying new recipes, and finding interesting new ingredients around New York City.
